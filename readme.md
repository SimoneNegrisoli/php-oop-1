# OOP-1

## Step 1

- a 'Movie' class is defined
  => instance variables are declared inside the class
  => a constructor is defined inside the class
  => at least one method is defined within the class
- at least two 'Movie' objects are instantiated and the values ​​of the related properties are printed on the screen

## Step 2

Create a complete layout to print a list of movies on the screen.
We pay attention to the organization of the code, dividing it into specific files and folders. For example, we can organize the code

- creating a file dedicated to the data (such as arrays of objects) which we could call db.php or use the attached files
- putting each class in its own file and perhaps grouping all the classes in a dedicated folder that we can call Models/
- organizing the layout by dividing the structure and contents into dedicated files and partials.

**Bonus 1:**
Modify the Movie class to accept more than one genre.

**Bonuses 2:**
Add a method to the Movie class (for example print the flag)
